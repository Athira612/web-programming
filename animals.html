<h1> ANIMALS </h1>
<img src="C:\Users\aathi\Desktop\lion.jfif">
<p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. 
Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. 
The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\aathi\Desktop\dog.jfif">
<p>Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. 
They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals ever to be domesticated.</p>
