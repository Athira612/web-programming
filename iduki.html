The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is spread across 777 km2 (300 sq mi), of which 360 km2 (140 sq mi) is thick evergreen forest. 
The wildlife sanctuary was declared a tiger reserve in 1978. The splendid artificial lake formed by the Mullaperiyar Dam across 
the Periyar River adds to the charm of the park. The greatest attractions of Periyar are the herds of wild elephants, deer, and bison that
come down to drink in the lake. The sanctuary can be accessed through a trekking route, boating, or jeep safari.Thekkady is considered 
a haven for natural spices such as black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg, nutmace, ginger, and clove.</p>
<p>The history of the present population is very recent. It is a history of colonisation braving inclement weather,
wild animals and epidemics. It is also a history of the exploitation of labour and labour struggles. 
Settling in the district began with seriousness during the ministry of Sri. T.K. Narayana Pillai as a sequence to the grow-more food 
campaign in the State. These migrants who constituted a few planters and a cross section of the people became the nucleus of the present population. 
During the ministry of Sri.Pattom Thanu Pillai systematic colonisation started. Kallar Pattom Colony in the Udumbanchola taluk bears the imprint of his name.
The earliest human habitation of the district which started from Tamil Nadu in the first two decades of the present century can be gauged from the story
that while Maharaja Sree Moolam Thirunal was personally supervising the construction of the Dam on Mullaperiyar river he felt thirsty and a shepherd 
called Ankur Rauther gave him milk from Udder of the sheep. The delighted Maharaja gave him title over extensive forest lands which his descendants sold 
to land owner’s in Tamil Nadu and with the help of cheap labour these were converted into Cardamom or Tea plantation. The area around Munnar was developed
from time to time when British made it their summer resort. As the immediate accessible population was from Tamil Nadu, Munnar became a Tamil pocket 
in Kerala.</p>

Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south.The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, 
namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations in the world. This hill station, which 
is more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes.[citation needed] Most of the native 
flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However,
some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east,the 
Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, 
the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani 
Hills National Park is proposed to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and 
endemic species including the Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri 
langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years).</p>
<p>The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the 
railway line to attract tourists.</p>
