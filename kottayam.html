<h2><u><font color="red">History</u></h2>
<p><font color="blue">
The name Kottayam is a combination of the words "kotta" and "akam" in the local language of Malayalam, meaning "interior of a fort".</p>
<p>
The current Kottayam district was previously part of the state of Travancore. Earlier, the Travancore state consisted of two revenue divisions: 
the southern and northern divisions, both under the administrative control of a "Diwan Peshkar" for each. 
Later in 1868, two more divisions—Kollam and Kottayam—were constituted. A fifth division Devikulam was added, but 
it only lasted for a short period, and was then joined with Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the state of Travancore and Kochi in 1949, 
these revenue divisions were renamed as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to district collectors, paving the way for the birth of 
the Kottayam district in July 1949. The cities included were Kottayam, Muvattupuzha (including present-day Kothamangalam), Thodupuzha, Changanasserry, 
Vaikkom, Meenachil, Devikulam and Peermade taluks.</p>
<p>
Kottayam has been involved in a number of political movements, including the 'Malayali Memorial' movement. 
The movements goal was more representation for Travancoreans in civil service.</p>
<p>
Vaikom Satyagraha, a protest against caste discrimination, took place in Kottayam district. 
The district also participated in the protests for responsible government in Travancore, which ended with the overthrow of Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, 
the Diwan of Travancore.</p>
